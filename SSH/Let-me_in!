Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.
Add the SSH public key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.
NOTE:
JUMP TO STEP 5 IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN YOUR SERVER
BUT IF YOUR SERVER HAS CLOSED, CARRY OUT STEP 1 - 5 AGAIN

STEPS:
HOW TO CONNECT TO YOUR WEB-01 SERVER
1. PLEASE OPEN YOUR (UBUNTU 20.04 LTS) SANDBOX AND RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS

	cd /root
	ls -a
	cd .ssh
	ls
	
2. //create a shell environment variable that contains information about the new agent instance
	
  eval $('ssh-agent')

3.//add the private key file for the "school" SSH key pair to the ssh-agent.	

  ssh-add ~/.ssh/school


PLEASE NOTE:
4. In the next command, REPLACE 18.234.168.34 with YOUR OWN IP ADDRESS 
//connect with your server

  ssh ubuntu@18.234.168.34

IF YOU HAVE CONNECTED SUCCESSFULLY you should see something like this:
ubuntu@web-01-server:~$

5. NOW TO ADD THE SSH KEY BELOW

ls -a

cd .ssh

6. //Lets add ALX into the party. you will see two RSA keys in the file, the first belongs to the company providing the server
the second RSA key is yours, you are about to bring ALX into this server

sudo vim authorized_keys

//go to the end of the file, copy and paste this new ssh key to the list of authorized_keys
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDNdtrNGtTXe5Tp1EJQop8mOSAuRGLjJ6DW4PqX4wId/Kawz35ESampIqHSOTJmbQ8UlxdJuk0gAXKk3Ncle4safGYqM/VeDK3LN5iAJxf4kcaxNtS3eVxWBE5iF3FbIjOqwxw5Lf5sRa5yXxA8HfWidhbIG5TqKL922hPgsCGABIrXRlfZYeC0FEuPWdr6smOElSVvIXthRWp9cr685KdCI+COxlj1RdVsvIo+zunmLACF9PYdjB2s96Fn0ocD3c5SGLvDOFCyvDojSAOyE70ebIElnskKsDTGwfT4P6jh9OBzTyQEIS2jOaE5RQq4IB4DsMhvbjDSQrP0MdCLgwkN

//save and exit the file
