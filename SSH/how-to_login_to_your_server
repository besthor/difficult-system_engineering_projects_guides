FIRST AND FOREMOST

STEP A:
HOW TO GENERATE SSH-KEY PAIRS
1. OPEN YOUR  Ubuntu 20.04 SANDBOX because  Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.

//run the following command ON UBUNTU 20.04 SANDBOX PLEASE  

cd /root

3. //this will generate a pair of cryptographic keys - a private key and a public key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f  /root/.ssh/school

4. //this command will prompt you to enter the name of the file where the new file will be save, type:

school

5. //This will also prompt you to enter a "PassPhrase". A passphrase is a sequence of words, numbers, or symbols 
that are used as a password to protect access to a computer system or network

6. PLEASE USE A PASSPHRASE THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER

YOU SHOULD GET AN IMAGE LIKE THIS:

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in school.
Your public key has been saved in school.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
5d:a8:c1:f5:98:b6:e5:c0:9b:ee:02:c4:d4:01:f3:ba vagrant@ubuntu
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 4096]----+
|      oo...      |
|      .+.o =     |
|     o  + B +    |
|      o. = O     |
|     .. S = .    |
|      .. .       |
|      E.  .      |
|        ..       |
|         ..      |
+-----------------+


7.//run the following commands. this will show you 2 files, school.pub (this file conains your public key)
school (this file contains your private keys and shool be stored in a safe place)

ls -a

cd .ssh

ls

vi school.pub

STEP B:
 HOW TO SAVE YOUR PUBLIC KEY ON YOUR PROFILE PAGE
a. Copy the content of the school.pub file
b. Go to you ALX INTRANET 
c. Go to "My Profile"
d. Go to "Technical information" section
e. Paste the public key 
f. Scroll down and click "Save my information"
g. You should get this prompt "Your profile was successfully updated."

STEP C:
HOW TO ASK FOR A NEW SERVER
//Go back to the SSH project page
1. Scroll down to "Your Servers"
you should see a similar table like this

Name	            Username	    IP	                State	
120054-web-01	    ubuntu	      57.109.118.560  	  pending   `ACTIONS`

2. Click on "Actions"
3. Click on "Ask a new server"
4. Wait for the page to load
5. If your server State is still showing "Pending"
6. Please relaod the page until the state shows "Running"                                     


STEP D:
HOW TO CONNECT TO YOUR WEB-01 SERVER
1. PLEASE OPEN YOUR (UBUNTU 20.04 LTS) SANDBOX AND RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS

	cd /root
  ls -a
	cd .ssh
	ls
	
2. //create a shell environment variable that contains information about the new agent instance
	
  eval $('ssh-agent')

3.//add the private key file for the "school" SSH key pair to the ssh-agent.	

  ssh-add ~/.ssh/school


PLEASE NOTE:
4. In the next command, REPLACE 18.234.168.34 with YOUR OWN IP ADDRESS 
//connect with your server

  ssh ubuntu@18.234.168.34

IF YOU HAVE CONNECTED SUCCESSFULLY you should see something like this:
ubuntu@web-01-server:~$

NOW,You can begin the tasks in the project
